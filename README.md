# ML_Portfolio
ML Portfolio for CS4375

---
## [Skills and Topics](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/skills/README.md)
This is a condensed overview of the various technical skills included in the portfolio, as well as soft skills I used throughout the course.

## [Overview of ML](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Overview%20of%20ML.pdf)
This is a brief overview of my first impressions of ML, detailing my understanding and thoughts on Machine Learning

---
## [Data Exploration](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Data_Exploration/data_exploration.cpp)
My first project in Intro to Machine Learning. I use C++ and explore taking measurements from a simple dataset. This is in preparation to use R and understand the various statistical measurements I will find myself using in the future. There is also a [document](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Data_Exploration/Data%20Exploration.pdf) detailing my first impressions about these statistical measurements.

---
## [Linear Models](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/tree/main/Linear_Models)
My partner and I explore regression and classification in R using medium-sized datasets. We created simple models and wrote thorough explanations about the graphs for each dataset.

The [regression model](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Linear_Models/Regression.pdf) uses a dataset about [diamonds](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Linear_Models/Diamonds%20Prices2022.csv), while the [classification model](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Linear_Models/Classification.pdf) uses a dataset about [music genres](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Linear_Models/MusicGenre.csv).

---
## [C++ Algorithms from Scratch](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/tree/main/Algorithms_from_Scratch)

Here, I explore how to program simple versions of machine learning algorithms in C++ from scratch. My partner and I code logistic regression and Naive Bayes algorithms and analyze a dataset from survivors of the Titanic.

---
## [Similarity and Ensemble](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/tree/main/Searching_for_Similarity)
This project comprises four different documents that explore the various ways to search for similarity in a dataset:

- [Regression](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Searching_for_Similarity/Regression.pdf)
- [Classification](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Searching_for_Similarity/Classification.pdf)
- [Clustering](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Searching_for_Similarity/Clustering.pdf)
- [Dimensionality Reduction](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Searching_for_Similarity/Dimensionality_Reduction.pdf)

---
## [Python ML with sklearn](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/sklearn/ML_with_sklearn.pdf)

I explore how to use sklearn in Python to perform data exploration, visualize our dataset, and create various models to fit the dataset to. I then analyze the models and determine strengths and weaknesses of each one.


---
## [Image Classification](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Image_Classification/image_classification.pdf)

My partner and I explore classification using a dataset of images. We attempt to fit various models and make improvements based on observations and our understanding of neural networks.

## Summary

Going to Intro to Machine Learning, I had little expectations for how much more I would learn. Prior, I had completed the course, Human Language Technologies, which focused on NLP (Natural Language Processing) and as a result learned a moderate amount about how machine learning algorithms work. After finishing this course, however, I realize I have learned so much more. I believe I truly understand the algorithms I have been taught, and I understand when and where to use them with respect to varying circumstances. As of the time of writing this (April 2023), I am already utilizing my knowledge of ML and NLP to create modern applications that incorporate these techniques that I have learned over this year. I expect that, in the future, machine learning and NLP will continue to heavily influence the world, and I see myself contributing in this aspect. I look forward to working in companies that embrace the potential of AI, ML, and NLP, as I truly enjoy these topics and will continue to learn more on my own.
