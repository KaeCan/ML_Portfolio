## [Overview of ML](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Overview%20of%20ML.pdf)
This is a brief overview of my first impressions of ML, detailing my understanding and thoughts on Machine Learning

## [Data Exploration](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Data_Exploration/data_exploration.cpp)
My first project in Intro to Machine Learning. I use C++ and explore taking measurements from a simple dataset. This is in preparation to use R and understand the various statistical measurements I will find myself using in the future. There is also a [document](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Data_Exploration/Data%20Exploration.pdf) detailing my first impressions about these statistical measurements.

## [Linear Models](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/tree/main/Linear_Models)
My partner and I explore regression and classification in R using medium-sized datasets. We created simple models and wrote thorough explanations about the graphs for each dataset.

The [regression model](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Linear_Models/Regression.pdf) uses a dataset about [diamonds](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Linear_Models/Diamonds%20Prices2022.csv), while the [classification model](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Linear_Models/Classification.pdf) uses a dataset about [music genres]().
