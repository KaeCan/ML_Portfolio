# ML_Portfolio
ML Portfolio for CS4375

## [Skills and Topics]()
This is a condensed overview of the various technical skills included in the portfolio, as well as soft skills I used throughout the course.

## [Overview of ML](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Overview%20of%20ML.pdf)
This is a brief overview of my first impressions of ML, detailing my understanding and thoughts on Machine Learning

---
## [Data Exploration](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Data_Exploration/data_exploration.cpp)
My first project in Intro to Machine Learning. I use C++ and explore taking measurements from a simple dataset. This is in preparation to use R and understand the various statistical measurements I will find myself using in the future. There is also a [document](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Data_Exploration/Data%20Exploration.pdf) detailing my first impressions about these statistical measurements.

## [Linear Models](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/tree/main/Linear_Models)
My partner and I explore regression and classification in R using medium-sized datasets. We created simple models and wrote thorough explanations about the graphs for each dataset.

The [regression model](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Linear_Models/Regression.pdf) uses a dataset about [diamonds](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Linear_Models/Diamonds%20Prices2022.csv), while the [classification model](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Linear_Models/Classification.pdf) uses a dataset about [music genres](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Linear_Models/MusicGenre.csv).

## [C++ Algorithms from Scratch](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/tree/main/Algorithms_from_Scratch)

Here, I explore how to program simple versions of machine learning algorithms in C++ from scratch. My partner and I code logistic regression and Naive Bayes algorithms and analyze a dataset from survivors of the Titanic.

---
## [Similarity and Ensemble](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/tree/main/Searching_for_Similarity)
This project comprises four different documents that explore the various ways to search for similarity in a dataset:

- [Regression]()
- [Classification]()
- [Clustering]()
- [Dimensionality Reduction]()

---
## [Python ML with sklearn](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/sklearn/ML_with_sklearn.pdf)

I explore how to use sklearn in Python to perform data exploration, visualize our dataset, and create various models to fit the dataset to. I then analyze the models and determine strengths and weaknesses of each one.


---
## [Image Classification](https://github.com/KaeCan/ML_Portfolio/blob/main/Image_Classification/image_classification.pdf)

My partner and I explore classification using a dataset of images. We attempt to fit various models and make improvements based on observations and our understanding of neural networks.
